## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background

This is my assignment project to Programming for Data Analysis module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2019.

This repository documents my intial research, project progress (git version control) and findings to the `numpy.random` library. As it is a learning exercise for me, I have made attempt to comment various funtionalities also for my future reference.

The detailed Project instructions to be found in the assignment description file:
<https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-machstat/raw/master/project.pdf>.

The assignment has been carried out on Numpy version 1.17.2 (updated on 11-10-2019).

## 1.2 Project delivery

- GitHub (link to the repository)
- README.md file (this file) with my research description
- Jupyter Notebook (name, github link)
