# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background

This is my assignment project to Programming for Data Analysis module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2019.

This repository documents my intial research, project progress (git version control) and findings to the `numpy.random` library. As it is a learning exercise for me, I have made attempt to comment various funtionalities also for my future reference.

The detailed Project instructions to be found in the assignment description file:
<https://github.com/brianmcginley/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf>.

The assignment has been carried out on Numpy version 1.17.2 (updated on 11-10-2019).

## 1.2 Assignment delivery

The assignment is delivered via this repository on [GitHub]<https://github.com/andkoc001/fun-with-numpy-random>.

The research is carried out with the help of Jupyter Notebook, where I test and illustrate the `numpy.random` concepts with code snipets as well as program outputs. The [Notebook] can be found at <https://github.com/andkoc001/fun-with-numpy-random/blob/master/exploring-random-numpy.ipynb>. This README.md file should be read in conjuntion with the Notebook.

For clarity, the Notebook may be later (I will see how the assignment goes) divided into several ones, each dealing a specific topic.

Furthermore, I intend to set up another Notebook for my testing and exploring the funtionality. It is going to be an unofficial part of my research - my sandbox.

This README.md file contains my research description, progress and findings.
